I have an interest in photography and love to grab my camera and take some photographs when I get the chance. Also in my spare time I enjoy making websites for my own personal gain, I do this to challenge myself so that I can learn new techniques that will better my skills. I love reading fiction and I keep healthy through my love of sports such as football and squash.
